 ⚠ Warning: Next.js inferred your workspace root, but it may not be correct.
 We detected multiple lockfiles and selected the directory of C:\Downloaded Web Sites\zk\package-lock.json as the root directory.
 To silence this warning, set `turbopack.root` in your Next.js config, or consider removing one of the lockfiles if it's not needed.
   See https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/config/next-config-js/turbopack#root-directory for more information.
 Detected additional lockfiles: 
   * C:\Downloaded Web Sites\zk\zk-next\package-lock.json

 ⨯ Unable to acquire lock at C:\Downloaded Web Sites\zk\zk-next\.next\lock, is another instance of next build running?
   Suggestion: If you intended to restart next build, terminate the other process, and then try again.
